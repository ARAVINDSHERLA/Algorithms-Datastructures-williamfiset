Hello and welcome to this Graph Theory algorithms course, my name is William, 
and I will be your instructor throughout these videos!

Graph theory is the Mathematical study of networks; any type of network, whether
it is a social network, a transportation network, a biology ancestor tree or an
in memory database.
Graph theory is how applications such as Google Maps, Facebook and Uber help you
navigate the world and connect you with your closed friends.
Graph theory is one of the most applicable topics on Mathematics and computer
science. This course focuses on graph theory algorithms in computer science and
how they are used and applied in the real world to do something useful.
