/**
 * SkipList is a data structure that is useful for dealing with dynamic sorted data. In particular
 * it gives O(log(n)) average complexity of insertion, removal, and find operations. This
 * implementation has been augmented with a method for determining the rank of an element in the
 * SkipList. Finding the rank of an element is also O(log(n)) on average. The complexities are
 * average complexities since this algorithm is dependent on randomisation to achieve nice balanced
 * properties. To make this efficient, instantiate the SkipList with a height equal to, or just
 * greater than, log(n) where n is the number of elements that will be in the list. On average, this
 * data structure uses O(n) space. Worst case space is O(nlog(n)), and worst case for all other
 * operations is O(n)
